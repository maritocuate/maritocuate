<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mario</h1>
<h3 align="center">
Lately I working with ReactJs for over three years now using design patterns (HOC, Presentational, Provider, Compound, etc). I prefer Jest for unit testing, and I also use Cypress for end-to-end testing.
For some projects where I need to work server-side I use NextJs 14 (TypeScript) with Prisma for the NoSQL databases (MongoDB).

Through the years I acquired strong understanding of vanilla JavaScript and general knowledge in popular libraries like jQuery, GSAP, Bootstrap, etc.
I have experience with source control using Git and SVN.
Familiar with NodeJS and Express. Although I mostly use Django.
Campaign tracking with Google Web Analytics and Google Tag Manager.
CI/CD with CircleCI.

Passion for new challenges, coding practices and a desire to develop new bold ideas.
