👋 Hi! I'm Mario.

💻 I'm a web developer based in Buenos Aires 🇦🇷.<br>Over 10 years ago, I started my journey in programming with ActionScript 2 (back when Flash ruled the web 🌐). As Flash became obsolete, I transitioned to JavaScript and have since kept up to date with modern frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

🚀 Software development is my passion—I’m always looking for new challenges and exciting projects where I can apply my knowledge and continue growing as a professional.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together! ✨
